# Introduction

This repo servers to better assist users with modifying the SV08 printer.<br>
This repo also will eventually include guides that sovol declined to have made

*Sovol basically told me that they will not be making any changes to their github. This makes me sad for the community and its really not how open-source should work. Its disrespectful to the open source community....*

> [!NOTE]
> This repo no longer contains the source code of the printer. keeping up with the changes that sovol is making would require too much effort on my part. 


> [!CAUTION]
> Sovol will NOT give you support if you modify ANY files on your printer. this includes tuning. before you email sovol for support you must follow the factory reset guide or [Re-flash the EMMC](guides/EMMC_Reflash_Guide.md).
